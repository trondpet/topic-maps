   {billy-corgan, biography, [[Billy Corgan was born on March 17th 1967 in Elk Grove - a suburb to Chicago, IL. 
He was christened William Patrick Corgan after his father, a professional 
blues rock guitarist (Corgan sr. is in fact playing on The Last Song - 
a track on Smashing Pumpkins' single Thirty-Three). When Billy was 3 years old, his father divorced 
his mother, and Billy Corgan was shuffled around from one family member 
to another. At age 9 his father had remarried and Billy had gotten a step-brother 
- Jesse - who had mild cerebral palsy, Tourette's syndrome, heart problems 
and a chromosomal disorder. Billy was left to take care of Jesse, and 
because of this responsibility he grew up quickly. Lots of his musical 
inspiration is said to steam from his teen-age sufferings (for instance: 
the song Spaceboy (on Smashing Pumpkins 2nd album; Siamese Dream) was 
dedicated to Jesse). At age 11 his father divorced again, and Billy shared 
home with his former stepmother as neither his biological mother or father 
wanted to take the responsibility of looking after him (although they 
lived separately and only an hour from him). Billy took on responsibility 
for his brother Jesse and became a father figure for him. Billy often 
took Jesse along to his baseball team practices and games, where the other 
kids made fun of Jesse - the &quot;retarded kid&quot;. Things didn't get 
easier for Billy. At Glenbard North High School he felt very much like 
a loner.


Around 1985 he formed his first band, <a href="http://www.blamo.org/sp/marked/">The 
Marked</a> ('The Marked' after a birth mark on one of Billy's and the 
drummer's hands). The Marked moved from Chicago to St. Petersburg, Florida. 
They played for about 9 months, but got nowhere, so Billy finally picked 
up his things and moved back to Chicago. Back in Chicago he was broke, 
and stayed with his dad. In Chicago he met <a href="http://www.jamesiha.org">James 
Iha</a>, D'arcy Wretzky and Jimmy Chamberlin and formed The 
Smashing Pumpkins (in 1988). Billy's first performance with James 
Iha was in a polish bar named 'Track'. The Smashing Pumpkins' first real 
gig was as an opening for Jane's Addiction (at the Metro 10-05-1988).


Billy Corgan and Courtney Love (Hole) had a romantic relationship. 
In 1992 he married Chris Fabian, a museum artist. He later dedicated 
the songs Soma (on Siamese Dream) and Muzzle (on Mellon Collie...) 
to her. He described her as &quot;<i>The best friend you could 
have for the last ten years.</i>&quot;, but after she filed for 
divorce in 1996, he came to speak of her in other terms (like: 
<i>"She didn't even like my first album, the bitch"</i>). After 
an interview with the magazine <a href="http://www.disneyland.com">Playboy</a> 
in 1997, he met the photographer Yelena Yemchuck (she did the 
photographs for Adore and the Adore singles), who he's still dating 
(she's said not to believe in marriage).


On May 25th 2000 Billy Corgan announced (on KROQ) that the Smashing Pumpkins 
would break up at the end of the year. Later that same year, the album 
<a href="http://www.billy-corgan.com/downloads/mp3/machina2/" target="_blank">MACHINA 
II / the friends and enemies of modern music</a> was released as the first 
ever internet-only album (because Virgin Records didn't want to release 
the album - not as a MACHINA / the machines of God bonus disc, nor as 
a &quot;follow-up&quot; album) - except from 25 LP sets (<a href="http://www.billy-corgan.com/downloads/mp3/machina2/">more 
info</a>). The &quot;old&quot; Smashing Pumpkins played their last ever gig at the Metro 
in Chicago on the 2nd of December 2000. In 2001 Billy Corgan formed a 
new band, Zwan.]]}

as desires on my ghost trains

it pours down the back of the bitter son
desperate for love and loves everyone
in my mother's arms no simple harm

conspires to hold on
for this heart, a little bit closer
try to hold on
to this love alone
try to hold on
and we know if we go under
we just can't let go
no, no

if i lose and just shatter
will you cry, and keep crying
will i die, and keep dying
in tokyo, with sad tragic blues
like you said it's how you use

'cause someday we'll know if this even matters
our rings and maze and simplicity
when can we laugh and take all the credit

and know we'll go free
with our hearts a little bit stronger
try to hold on
for this love alone
try to hold on
for this heart's a little bit frightened
just try to hold on
just try to hold on

wheelwagon dust 
weeds and infidelities 
and always swore our love 
never questioned why 
in a wooden house 
immovable and silent 
and drinking strawberry wine 
forever lost in town 

and through the sleeping streets 
nightbound and heavy 
wheels in a spoke 
just a spoken foreign sound 

know my gates are high 
my friends even higher 
forgotten in my mind 
yet the scars still lingering 
cloud the blue skies 
i'm jealous of you birds 
was the only truth 
in a world full of words 

hear the prairie sound 
in a friend called neil 
the heart is pointed down 
but my spirit pointed up 
his voice the siren 
of greek mythology 

i pause with my pen 
i begin to defend 
every action taken 
every moment sealed 
when i was quick 
it coursed through open veins 
the will to live 
the urgency to move 
behind a panel door 
sealing cherry stain 
i played my guitar 
and lived those lonesome notes 

like a dog that's down 
in a corner just aside 
waiting to be called 
waiting to be yours 
ghosts of a machine 
without purpose or will 

i'll often speak of you 
but the you was always me 
'cause when i speak of me 
it's me i ask of you 
so let there be no truth 
just trickery in rhymes 
time the only thing 
waiting still is death 

i hope for resolution 
pray one defining moment 
pause without restraint 
barren without child 
a child is who i was 
a child is who i'll die 
a child is who i'll die 

soot in my hair 
and stars in my hands 
soot in my hair 
and stars in my hands 
soot in my hair 
and stars in my hands]]}

just one more song to slay this earth

it was all i had, but not all i need
and i can't escape the fact that i still bleed

and if you're still feeling down
and if this seems way too loud
then maybe you need me around

i had no voice
i had no drive
i had no choice
i've done my time
i had myself
had my band
i had my love

bring your tulips and your flowers
chrysanthemums and guile

when candy comes calling so in love

say it ain't so kid, say it ain't so

stealing in the shadows

so bring your sanskrit and a hounddog hell
leave your [?\u00005D

just bring a piece of luck
and raise a loving cup

lost in converstation and thought
she forgot nothing but where i was
to let me bide easing
she paused with a wink, a nod, and a smile
i caught enough to miss her
at least not for a little while

and one day you'll find
i got just what i wanted here
in empty books and the baby hooks
with the names of the girls with a dull embrace

hey, hello, how are you
didn't we meet at a costume ball
she laughed, no, it's different, it was not
a dark alley pissing on a wall
that's when i knew we're meant to fall

and one day you will find
i got just what i wanted here
some old soot and the vacant look
of the girls who just enjoy the chase

and so we talked to no one else
of premonitions come and gone
everything you know is wrong, she said
i know you know you're wrong, she said
let's go, i know the way to go
within, without
you're so lucky to let this out

and one day you'll find
i got just what i wanted here
a cracked rook on the highest brook
straying out at the girls i can't disgrace

i love you, i slipped and she began to come
she caught watching, said i'm never far
couldn't even tell me you what want
she wanted what she wanted and i felt cold
i know i'm gone from someone

maybe i saw you kicking a can
leading to lambs to gutters to understand
why they're all boys and you're a man
i'm sure you bet them all to star
staring at your noon stopwatch

and one day i'll find
i got just what i wanted here
a dull glen with the never then
of a girl with the gravity [?\u00005D

she spoke in the lilt of insatiable chase
all vain glory and cruel face
of riddle rhymes i can't replace, not now
not every with what i take

to my disdain her apathy hurt
and i was only trying to flirt
little still known of my fate
the oracle hung around like deadweight

and one day we'll all find
we get just what we wanted here
broken arms and some tarnished charms
of a jewel gone astray as [?\u00005D

so now it's time for questions
it's no answers and all smiles
pleasing and amusing as i
pleasedfor a little while
she said, let's go for a walk or picture show
one wish, honest
to wipe away the loneliness

escape by a river to take her in
she cursed out loud and pushed me in
now let's see if you'll sink or swim
i'll do what you can't do for, and then
i'll take you through all of it
the rumors and the lies and the bullshit
we'll wash away all our sin and grit
yours without and mine shoved in forever
and ever, always there, forever
and ever

and one day i'll find
she got just what she wanted here
the lazy looks and the things i took
from the ones who can't escape the frame

tied to a tree, trying to kiss her bow
trying to pry inside that soul
she turned her face as if to go
said within, nowhere else to go
i know i love you
as simple as i'm sweet
she hissed, you know you know no love
it does not

i've got just what i wanted here
wandered such for a little luck
from a girl cannot run the race

i am the girl of the bitter embrace
i am the girl you'll forever chase
with your loins burning, all eyes of hate
i'm pulling up and out to face
what do you need, you don't even know
a sad lone crane standing in the shallows
waiting for wind to blow

you've got it all wrong
i said, i fear
i see what you mean
and i hear what you hear
there is division in all that's at stake
but look at the beatiful crest of the wave i create

and maybe someday i will tell the truth
when i find someone who wants the truth
maybe someday i will tell the truth
when i find someone who wants the truth

and one day i'll find
i got just what i wanted here
a lonely place with my mind awake
against the girl with the girls with the cruel face

hey, look out, there goes a girl
who watched me diving for my pearls
hey, look out, there goes a girl
a woman who watched me dive for my pearls

Feet feet: walking a two mile.
Meet meet: meet me at the turnstile.
I never met him, I'll never forget him.

Dream dream: filling up an idle hour.
Fade away, radiate.

she gathered up the street
they used far too much dynamite
to bring down 300 hundred feet
of the wheel

a pauper plays his final act
refusing to lose

they need your summer rain
a temple to a single train

he drew the lines upon her breast
stopping to his eye
she stood and watched the ships come in
passing on her left
they're gone/gone/gone

cast in endless gold
our cold is pure will to change

cause i'm a sister, and i'm a motherfuck
i am made of shamrocks, i am made of stern stuff
i am never enough, i am the forgotten child
and i said i wanna fill you up, i wanna break you, i wanna give you up
from one another, no one should ever come
in between us, between us and our love
mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow
and everywhere that mary went i was sure to go
now mary's got a problem, and mary's not a stupid girl
mary's got some deep shit, and mary does not forget
and this is how mary's garden grows, and this is how mary has her ghosts
and into the eyes of the jackyl i say ka-boom
now we begin descent, to where we've never been
there is no going back, this wasn't meant to last
this is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve
and she will never learn
bye bye, baby goodbye]]}

that everything i operate on 
is based on what i believe god was telling me to do 
god could be my intuition or whatever 
but i always assume 
i always assume that the voice i hear is the voice of god 
then i started thinking 
what if i'm insane 
so i'm operating on the premise 
that i'm hearing the voice of god 
or what i perceive to be god speaking to me 
or through me 
but maybe i'm completly in... 
so all my... 
demagoguery in my life about me thinking that my life has importance 
my, my.. 
thinking that my life has importance 
my, my, my thought of it 
and the fact that i believe that i'm following my intuition 
which in and of itself may be completely false 
so then i started freaking out thinking... 
of itself may be completely false 
and again this creature that believes that he's acting upon 
heavenly intuition, but meanwhile he's totally rampant 
and i started thinking maybe this is the cause 
of all the negativity against...

of a vintl storm

we are losing contact as she dials it in 
she can hear glass calling 
or is it someone that looks like him 
she eyes tv reflection and nods a knowing look 
she says it doesn't matter 
she never liked her looks 
i have seen a thousand fractures 
i have seen everything 
cause knowing is it's own answer

not much left to cook

subtract, multiply. a message from above and below. my moleasskiss to your precious lips. don't think. just be my sweet sweet. two albums and some 27 other songs later-b-sides-complyiations, covers, soundtracks-this here is an assemblage of , well stuff. songs never meant to come out, some written with such high hopes.....
all special to the heart. from sub-plop to wergen, here 'tis.sadness and happiness.soothe-recorded in me bedroom at my old apartement. you can hear the 7am buses slithering by. i used to go to sleep to the flanging car noises. the hiss that we had missed. i really only wanted this to be for me. but my friend said "i don't think you can improve on that. so i left it be. plume- a groover from the iha file- assembled i - in same said bedroom and recorded only a couple of days later at kerry's studio. another demo thing that turned ugly and mean and got released. we didn't have any bass so we "borrowed" eric from deep blue dream's--he never knew and were sorry we didn't tell you eric but it sounds good. i know i wrote some of the lyrics waiting for my dad to pick me up from the aeroport. my boredom has outshined the sun. sometimes you don't spend as much time on the lyrics-ansX and sometimes they're better-more how you REALLY feel. soothe- a song for my babies. children of the earth and such. i wanted to put this on siamese dream but i x wimped out. shoulda coulda kinda didn't but i love it anyhow, makes me cry.Frail and bedazzled- written for the monolith in 92-- we just never got around to investing the proper time into this lullabye we recorded this in about 1 hour, and i wished we has spent more time, but.. another message(*2) from the me vs. rock file. wrote these lyrics in the parking garage where i used to live/rehearse. it was very cold in there-but quiet. you could hear the squaking tires at night, sounded like ghosts or something, but i wrote this message from me to you. infinite lost at word sea. whir--another recorded in an hour type thingers that has been in the box. part of the glynis lineage lineage- sweeet and saddness ive wasted all my years. i must have written that line a zillion times, it jus just ended up here. sometimes when i listen to this i hear who we really are. frail and gentle- it is what is. rock powerx100.. note scary ending we would play that part for 15 minutes dum-de-dum-de dum. frail and bedazzled owes a great debt to the band skunK, with whom i ripped part of this song off. skunk was probably the greatest band that i ever knew/saw that is virtual: unknown-even less than the frogs. frogs. skunk. i miss skunk. blew away- blew away - written and produced by the man himself, welcome to james. quiet and cool and whispered. this is a beautiful song. the only song we have ever done that i was not 9did not stick my nose into) and i am glad i didn't. not to be confused with blue. and i love her....
pissant is one of the few things we have ever recorded live. done during the siamese dream sessions late at night and full of teenage pain. i made up all tese lyrics in 10 minutes got me a ray gun, got me an attitude, can;t help feeling somethings wrong with everone o everyone o you don't know what it's about don't care rawk. kerry and d"arcy tried to talk me into Putting this on hte album and i was tempted, but no i just couldn't see it in there amongst the tall trees. not as much shade or room for the little ones. plume-plume features the maestro phase, on loan from matt s. if you substract our two albums-there are 27 more songs, at least that have been released. there are another 15 to 20 to 30 hidden away but they aren't very good. i went back and listened to it all because i didn't want you to be bored, and i also decided to leave drown and glynis well enough alone. so there are 25 songs left to choose from cause well whatever but o the 25 out there were 3 more hidden away. 27-2=30 27-2+30-30+3=pXXXXs XXXXXXXXX oonteen in all (count 'em)? fourteen. at akL all kinda goes together in some sort of wayhello kitty kat-now this song was a toughy because i really had intended to put this on that album. but the ghosts of gish said no no no so i left it alone kinda because i really destroyed the mix. my most passive aggresive song. say hello before you say goodbye i should go before you make me cry she wants to bleed every drop inside of me but i aim to please the little girl inside of me too you know i hate say i always stay i don't want to be like the others please who"s sorry now if is how you how..............
love to love to love what you adore skgjgdfbdgkjdkjgblkbghphhnd dbkej;eb assemble a somehwat continious collection of this.
obscured is old because it was originally supposed to be on the lull e.p which was really supposed to be a single but they tricked me. written during gish recordings, we have finished it and let it sit for 2 years and then it came out as the b side of today i in the uk. the darkland.
so it was on all my friends taped and supposed to be on the next one but i swore i would never again re -record one of our own songs because it is lame to do so. 1991.what a year. such a pretty song, sunday in the park music chicagofest. blew away has kerry playing drums cause jimmy was on vacation. landslide is a stevie nicks song. i fell in love with this song and forced myself to learn it XXX because i'm very bad at figuring out songs by other people. o course i learned it totally the wrong way and after it was recorde recorded jimmy from the frogs showed me an easier way to play it. this song is very relevant to my life at this moment still, and that is why o loved to sing it. landslide-was recorded at the bbc, not my favourite place to record. favourite place to record. they are still in 1971 but ted the producer man was very nice. the recording is way to hissy and we're sorry but it is the fault of the bbc, whose financial raping of us to use this song and sandoz almost didn't make putting these songs out possible. but it is here,
starla-my friend aneta still says to me that this song should have been on siamese dream. but back again to that no record x2 rule. this was recorded at the same time a splume, and was also intended to be a demo, but we needed b-sides, for our prettyXXXXXXXXXXXX worthless i am one u.k. single (the dark continent) so in a way plume and starla were they're own single if that make makes any sense at all. recorded over time, or recorded at two different sessions, one for vocals and solos and one for drums, erc,.another song with lyrics written at the last second. i wrote the middle part on the back of an eXXX envelope--serve yourself no one else can do for you like you an do one el else fails like me but in my eyes i i burn alive no more words just you and i high in the sky--some of my favourite lyrics. better that i did not care solo played at 7am. listen for the police car going bye. blue is the only gish outtake represented here. from the lull single! viva lull
and remastered by our man howie for yer listnin' pleasure. yet another sad and happy song from the o'corrigan file. i thought about using an acoustic version of this song for this album, but it seemed silly to have a different version of an unknown song. maybe someday . on tour forever, blue i lay with you this velvet morning sa stat stay with me for a while a million yeses and no's strewn across 6 long years. but all it adds up to something even if you are not quite sure of what that is. a girl named Sandoz-from our XX slightly infamous john Peel session. we of course showed up expecting to meet john peel, but it's not like that at all. we were 2 hours late due to technicak misunderstanding-- but we e
we were treated so poorly bX thi by this idiot who used to be the drummer from mott the supple that it is probably *l on our all time worst experiences list. this was originally recorded by the animals roughly around the time that jimy hendrix went to england to become... well you catch my drift. vented thru many years o out and out riffdom, this still sounds powerful to my jaded years, i mean we meant it back then,, but that was long agoe.
but that was long a go-go, so now listen hear, i want to be so oh so clear si so we only ended up recording 3 songs that day (siva and smiley too) because it was so uptight, but i'm glad we did tolerate that XXXXXXXX mott the nipple that day even though i don't think we would now.
i met this girl in dallas when we were on tour with the chili peppa's and that was where i got the idea for the name for the song because when she said her name i thought wow, what a XXX great title for a song. 2.25 years late later i run into this same girl at a party and i say did you hear that song we recorded using youur name, starla? and she said, no my name is darla but heXy starla, darla whatever it doesn't matter, so there you go. never trust a girl who ends up with, well i can't say. i am very proud of all these songs songs because they have persevered time and space and albums and most o all subjective opinion. yours truly included. La dolly vita -so old yet it is kinda timeless in a strange way. i think it is because it has a dignity all it's own. we also tried to re-record this for gish, but my heart was not in it. so many mistakes but the raygun is always on i catch my assumptipn. mary's always on the shoulder and the devil has his pitchwork on that backside o yours. la dolly vita, true as blue shy sky, cool as ice cream
the b-side o our second single recorded with butch vig. we recorded this and tristessa on the same day somewhere in the past and it was also the first day XXXXXXX we met butch v. still one o my favourite hidden songs, this brings b back many memories. sorry, a tad too personal. be careful what you say but be really careful what you don't say. spaced-is kinda hard to explain so i won't, but i you listen real close you can hear the 7 secrets of the 7 veils of apollo. part of the siamese desbris collection. thanks for being anf thanks for listening and thanks for getting angry and happy and sad all at the same time. life is everything and nothing at all at onece-if i may filanthripize--1/2 and we hope we mean those things to you. till next sign
billy c.
somebody X comes up to you in a bar and asks them if you are who they think you are, and then you say if you know then i am if you don't then i'm not.special thanks to everyone for their continued support
and a fuck to those who will never understand
love, peace, empathy, desire, mischief, and gladness

<p><span class="bold">Pisces Iscariot Notes</span>
subtract, multiply. a message from above and below. my moleasskiss to your precious lips. don't think. just be my sweet sweet. two albums and some 27 other songs later-b-sides-complyiations, covers, soundtracks-this here is an assemblage of , well stuff. songs never meant to come out, some written with such high hopes.....
all special to the heart. from sub-plop to wergen, here 'tis.sadness and happiness.soothe-recorded in me bedroom at my old apartement. you can hear the 7am buses slithering by. i used to go to sleep to the flanging car noises. the hiss that we had missed. i really only wanted this to be for me. but my friend said "i don't think you can improve on that. so i left it be. plume- a groover from the iha file- assembled i - in same said bedroom and recorded only a couple of days later at kerry's studio. another demo thing that turned ugly and mean and got released. we didn't have any bass so we "borrowed" eric from deep blue dream's--he never knew and were sorry we didn't tell you eric but it sounds good. i know i wrote some of the lyrics waiting for my dad to pick me up from the aeroport. my boredom has outshined the sun. sometimes you don't spend as much time on the lyrics-ansX and sometimes they're better-more how you REALLY feel. soothe- a song for my babies. children of the earth and such. i wanted to put this on siamese dream but i x wimped out. shoulda coulda kinda didn't but i love it anyhow, makes me cry.Frail and bedazzled- written for the monolith in 92-- we just never got around to investing the proper time into this lullabye we recorded this in about 1 hour, and i wished we has spent more time, but.. another message(*2) from the me vs. rock file. wrote these lyrics in the parking garage where i used to live/rehearse. it was very cold in there-but quiet. you could hear the squaking tires at night, sounded like ghosts or something, but i wrote this message from me to you. infinite lost at word sea. whir--another recorded in an hour type thingers that has been in the box. part of the glynis lineage lineage- sweeet and saddness ive wasted all my years. i must have written that line a zillion times, it jus just ended up here. sometimes when i listen to this i hear who we really are. frail and gentle- it is what is. rock powerx100.. note scary ending we would play that part for 15 minutes dum-de-dum-de dum. frail and bedazzled owes a great debt to the band skunK, with whom i ripped part of this song off. skunk was probably the greatest band that i ever knew/saw that is virtual: unknown-even less than the frogs. frogs. skunk. i miss skunk. blew away- blew away - written and produced by the man himself, welcome to james. quiet and cool and whispered. this is a beautiful song. the only song we have ever done that i was not 9did not stick my nose into) and i am glad i didn't. not to be confused with blue. and i love her....
pissant is one of the few things we have ever recorded live. done during the siamese dream sessions late at night and full of teenage pain. i made up all tese lyrics in 10 minutes got me a ray gun, got me an attitude, can;t help feeling somethings wrong with everone o everyone o you don't know what it's about don't care rawk. kerry and d"arcy tried to talk me into Putting this on hte album and i was tempted, but no i just couldn't see it in there amongst the tall trees. not as much shade or room for the little ones. plume-plume features the maestro phase, on loan from matt s. if you substract our two albums-there are 27 more songs, at least that have been released. there are another 15 to 20 to 30 hidden away but they aren't very good. i went back and listened to it all because i didn't want you to be bored, and i also decided to leave drown and glynis well enough alone. so there are 25 songs left to choose from cause well whatever but o the 25 out there were 3 more hidden away. 27-2=30 27-2+30-30+3=pXXXXs XXXXXXXXX oonteen in all (count 'em)? fourteen. at akL all kinda goes together in some sort of wayhello kitty kat-now this song was a toughy because i really had intended to put this on that album. but the ghosts of gish said no no no so i left it alone kinda because i really destroyed the mix. my most passive aggresive song. say hello before you say goodbye i should go before you make me cry she wants to bleed every drop inside of me but i aim to please the little girl inside of me too you know i hate say i always stay i don't want to be like the others please who"s sorry now if is how you how..............
love to love to love what you adore skgjgdfbdgkjdkjgblkbghphhnd dbkej;eb assemble a somehwat continious collection of this.
obscured is old because it was originally supposed to be on the lull e.p which was really supposed to be a single but they tricked me. written during gish recordings, we have finished it and let it sit for 2 years and then it came out as the b side of today i in the uk. the darkland.
so it was on all my friends taped and supposed to be on the next one but i swore i would never again re -record one of our own songs because it is lame to do so. 1991.what a year. such a pretty song, sunday in the park music chicagofest. blew away has kerry playing drums cause jimmy was on vacation. landslide is a stevie nicks song. i fell in love with this song and forced myself to learn it XXX because i'm very bad at figuring out songs by other people. o course i learned it totally the wrong way and after it was recorde recorded jimmy from the frogs showed me an easier way to play it. this song is very relevant to my life at this moment still, and that is why o loved to sing it. landslide-was recorded at the bbc, not my favourite place to record. favourite place to record. they are still in 1971 but ted the producer man was very nice. the recording is way to hissy and we're sorry but it is the fault of the bbc, whose financial raping of us to use this song and sandoz almost didn't make putting these songs out possible. but it is here,
starla-my friend aneta still says to me that this song should have been on siamese dream. but back again to that no record x2 rule. this was recorded at the same time a splume, and was also intended to be a demo, but we needed b-sides, for our prettyXXXXXXXXXXXX worthless i am one u.k. single (the dark continent) so in a way plume and starla were they're own single if that make makes any sense at all. recorded over time, or recorded at two different sessions, one for vocals and solos and one for drums, erc,.another song with lyrics written at the last second. i wrote the middle part on the back of an eXXX envelope--serve yourself no one else can do for you like you an do one el else fails like me but in my eyes i i burn alive no more words just you and i high in the sky--some of my favourite lyrics. better that i did not care solo played at 7am. listen for the police car going bye. blue is the only gish outtake represented here. from the lull single! viva lull
and remastered by our man howie for yer listnin' pleasure. yet another sad and happy song from the o'corrigan file. i thought about using an acoustic version of this song for this album, but it seemed silly to have a different version of an unknown song. maybe someday . on tour forever, blue i lay with you this velvet morning sa stat stay with me for a while a million yeses and no's strewn across 6 long years. but all it adds up to something even if you are not quite sure of what that is. a girl named Sandoz-from our XX slightly infamous john Peel session. we of course showed up expecting to meet john peel, but it's not like that at all. we were 2 hours late due to technicak misunderstanding-- but we e
we were treated so poorly bX thi by this idiot who used to be the drummer from mott the supple that it is probably *l on our all time worst experiences list. this was originally recorded by the animals roughly around the time that jimy hendrix went to england to become... well you catch my drift. vented thru many years o out and out riffdom, this still sounds powerful to my jaded years, i mean we meant it back then,, but that was long agoe.
but that was long a go-go, so now listen hear, i want to be so oh so clear si so we only ended up recording 3 songs that day (siva and smiley too) because it was so uptight, but i'm glad we did tolerate that XXXXXXXX mott the nipple that day even though i don't think we would now.
i met this girl in dallas when we were on tour with the chili peppa's and that was where i got the idea for the name for the song because when she said her name i thought wow, what a XXX great title for a song. 2.25 years late later i run into this same girl at a party and i say did you hear that song we recorded using youur name, starla? and she said, no my name is darla but heXy starla, darla whatever it doesn't matter, so there you go. never trust a girl who ends up with, well i can't say. i am very proud of all these songs songs because they have persevered time and space and albums and most o all subjective opinion. yours truly included. La dolly vita -so old yet it is kinda timeless in a strange way. i think it is because it has a dignity all it's own. we also tried to re-record this for gish, but my heart was not in it. so many mistakes but the raygun is always on i catch my assumptipn. mary's always on the shoulder and the devil has his pitchwork on that backside o yours. la dolly vita, true as blue shy sky, cool as ice cream
the b-side o our second single recorded with butch vig. we recorded this and tristessa on the same day somewhere in the past and it was also the first day XXXXXXX we met butch v. still one o my favourite hidden songs, this brings b back many memories. sorry, a tad too personal. be careful what you say but be really careful what you don't say. spaced-is kinda hard to explain so i won't, but i you listen real close you can hear the 7 secrets of the 7 veils of apollo. part of the siamese desbris collection. thanks for being anf thanks for listening and thanks for getting angry and happy and sad all at the same time. life is everything and nothing at all at onece-if i may filanthripize--1/2 and we hope we mean those things to you. till next sign
billy c.
somebody X comes up to you in a bar and asks them if you are who they think you are, and then you say if you know then i am if you don't then i'm not.special thanks to everyone for their continued support

subtract, multiply. a message from above and below. my moleasskiss to your precious lips. don't think. just be my sweet sweet. two albums and some 27 other songs later-b-sides-complyiations, covers, soundtracks-this here is an assemblage of , well stuff. songs never meant to come out, some written with such high hopes.....
all special to the heart. from sub-plop to wergen, here 'tis.sadness and happiness.soothe-recorded in me bedroom at my old apartement. you can hear the 7am buses slithering by. i used to go to sleep to the flanging car noises. the hiss that we had missed. i really only wanted this to be for me. but my friend said "i don't think you can improve on that. so i left it be. plume- a groover from the iha file- assembled i - in same said bedroom and recorded only a couple of days later at kerry's studio. another demo thing that turned ugly and mean and got released. we didn't have any bass so we "borrowed" eric from deep blue dream's--he never knew and were sorry we didn't tell you eric but it sounds good. i know i wrote some of the lyrics waiting for my dad to pick me up from the aeroport. my boredom has outshined the sun. sometimes you don't spend as much time on the lyrics-ansX and sometimes they're better-more how you REALLY feel. soothe- a song for my babies. children of the earth and such. i wanted to put this on siamese dream but i x wimped out. shoulda coulda kinda didn't but i love it anyhow, makes me cry.Frail and bedazzled- written for the monolith in 92-- we just never got around to investing the proper time into this lullabye we recorded this in about 1 hour, and i wished we has spent more time, but.. another message(*2) from the me vs. rock file. wrote these lyrics in the parking garage where i used to live/rehearse. it was very cold in there-but quiet. you could hear the squaking tires at night, sounded like ghosts or something, but i wrote this message from me to you. infinite lost at word sea. whir--another recorded in an hour type thingers that has been in the box. part of the glynis lineage lineage- sweeet and saddness ive wasted all my years. i must have written that line a zillion times, it jus just ended up here. sometimes when i listen to this i hear who we really are. frail and gentle- it is what is. rock powerx100.. note scary ending we would play that part for 15 minutes dum-de-dum-de dum. frail and bedazzled owes a great debt to the band skunK, with whom i ripped part of this song off. skunk was probably the greatest band that i ever knew/saw that is virtual: unknown-even less than the frogs. frogs. skunk. i miss skunk. blew away- blew away - written and produced by the man himself, welcome to james. quiet and cool and whispered. this is a beautiful song. the only song we have ever done that i was not 9did not stick my nose into) and i am glad i didn't. not to be confused with blue. and i love her....
pissant is one of the few things we have ever recorded live. done during the siamese dream sessions late at night and full of teenage pain. i made up all tese lyrics in 10 minutes got me a ray gun, got me an attitude, can;t help feeling somethings wrong with everone o everyone o you don't know what it's about don't care rawk. kerry and d"arcy tried to talk me into Putting this on hte album and i was tempted, but no i just couldn't see it in there amongst the tall trees. not as much shade or room for the little ones. plume-plume features the maestro phase, on loan from matt s. if you substract our two albums-there are 27 more songs, at least that have been released. there are another 15 to 20 to 30 hidden away but they aren't very good. i went back and listened to it all because i didn't want you to be bored, and i also decided to leave drown and glynis well enough alone. so there are 25 songs left to choose from cause well whatever but o the 25 out there were 3 more hidden away. 27-2=30 27-2+30-30+3=pXXXXs XXXXXXXXX oonteen in all (count 'em)? fourteen. at akL all kinda goes together in some sort of wayhello kitty kat-now this song was a toughy because i really had intended to put this on that album. but the ghosts of gish said no no no so i left it alone kinda because i really destroyed the mix. my most passive aggresive song. say hello before you say goodbye i should go before you make me cry she wants to bleed every drop inside of me but i aim to please the little girl inside of me too you know i hate say i always stay i don't want to be like the others please who"s sorry now if is how you how..............
love to love to love what you adore skgjgdfbdgkjdkjgblkbghphhnd dbkej;eb assemble a somehwat continious collection of this.
obscured is old because it was originally supposed to be on the lull e.p which was really supposed to be a single but they tricked me. written during gish recordings, we have finished it and let it sit for 2 years and then it came out as the b side of today i in the uk. the darkland.
so it was on all my friends taped and supposed to be on the next one but i swore i would never again re -record one of our own songs because it is lame to do so. 1991.what a year. such a pretty song, sunday in the park music chicagofest. blew away has kerry playing drums cause jimmy was on vacation. landslide is a stevie nicks song. i fell in love with this song and forced myself to learn it XXX because i'm very bad at figuring out songs by other people. o course i learned it totally the wrong way and after it was recorde recorded jimmy from the frogs showed me an easier way to play it. this song is very relevant to my life at this moment still, and that is why o loved to sing it. landslide-was recorded at the bbc, not my favourite place to record. favourite place to record. they are still in 1971 but ted the producer man was very nice. the recording is way to hissy and we're sorry but it is the fault of the bbc, whose financial raping of us to use this song and sandoz almost didn't make putting these songs out possible. but it is here,
starla-my friend aneta still says to me that this song should have been on siamese dream. but back again to that no record x2 rule. this was recorded at the same time a splume, and was also intended to be a demo, but we needed b-sides, for our prettyXXXXXXXXXXXX worthless i am one u.k. single (the dark continent) so in a way plume and starla were they're own single if that make makes any sense at all. recorded over time, or recorded at two different sessions, one for vocals and solos and one for drums, erc,.another song with lyrics written at the last second. i wrote the middle part on the back of an eXXX envelope--serve yourself no one else can do for you like you an do one el else fails like me but in my eyes i i burn alive no more words just you and i high in the sky--some of my favourite lyrics. better that i did not care solo played at 7am. listen for the police car going bye. blue is the only gish outtake represented here. from the lull single! viva lull
and remastered by our man howie for yer listnin' pleasure. yet another sad and happy song from the o'corrigan file. i thought about using an acoustic version of this song for this album, but it seemed silly to have a different version of an unknown song. maybe someday . on tour forever, blue i lay with you this velvet morning sa stat stay with me for a while a million yeses and no's strewn across 6 long years. but all it adds up to something even if you are not quite sure of what that is. a girl named Sandoz-from our XX slightly infamous john Peel session. we of course showed up expecting to meet john peel, but it's not like that at all. we were 2 hours late due to technicak misunderstanding-- but we e
we were treated so poorly bX thi by this idiot who used to be the drummer from mott the supple that it is probably *l on our all time worst experiences list. this was originally recorded by the animals roughly around the time that jimy hendrix went to england to become... well you catch my drift. vented thru many years o out and out riffdom, this still sounds powerful to my jaded years, i mean we meant it back then,, but that was long agoe.
but that was long a go-go, so now listen hear, i want to be so oh so clear si so we only ended up recording 3 songs that day (siva and smiley too) because it was so uptight, but i'm glad we did tolerate that XXXXXXXX mott the nipple that day even though i don't think we would now.
i met this girl in dallas when we were on tour with the chili peppa's and that was where i got the idea for the name for the song because when she said her name i thought wow, what a XXX great title for a song. 2.25 years late later i run into this same girl at a party and i say did you hear that song we recorded using youur name, starla? and she said, no my name is darla but heXy starla, darla whatever it doesn't matter, so there you go. never trust a girl who ends up with, well i can't say. i am very proud of all these songs songs because they have persevered time and space and albums and most o all subjective opinion. yours truly included. La dolly vita -so old yet it is kinda timeless in a strange way. i think it is because it has a dignity all it's own. we also tried to re-record this for gish, but my heart was not in it. so many mistakes but the raygun is always on i catch my assumptipn. mary's always on the shoulder and the devil has his pitchwork on that backside o yours. la dolly vita, true as blue shy sky, cool as ice cream
the b-side o our second single recorded with butch vig. we recorded this and tristessa on the same day somewhere in the past and it was also the first day XXXXXXX we met butch v. still one o my favourite hidden songs, this brings b back many memories. sorry, a tad too personal. be careful what you say but be really careful what you don't say. spaced-is kinda hard to explain so i won't, but i you listen real close you can hear the 7 secrets of the 7 veils of apollo. part of the siamese desbris collection. thanks for being anf thanks for listening and thanks for getting angry and happy and sad all at the same time. life is everything and nothing at all at onece-if i may filanthripize--1/2 and we hope we mean those things to you. till next sign

all special to the heart. from sub-plop to wergen, here 'tis.sadness and happiness.soothe-recorded in me bedroom at my old apartement. you can hear the 7am buses slithering by. i used to go to sleep to the flanging car noises. the hiss that we had missed. i really only wanted this to be for me. but my friend said "i don't think you can improve on that. so i left it be. plume- a groover from the iha file- assembled i - in same said bedroom and recorded only a couple of days later at kerry's studio. another demo thing that turned ugly and mean and got released. we didn't have any bass so we "borrowed" eric from deep blue dream's--he never knew and were sorry we didn't tell you eric but it sounds good. i know i wrote some of the lyrics waiting for my dad to pick me up from the aeroport. my boredom has outshined the sun. sometimes you don't spend as much time on the lyrics-ansX and sometimes they're better-more how you REALLY feel. soothe- a song for my babies. children of the earth and such. i wanted to put this on siamese dream but i x wimped out. shoulda coulda kinda didn't but i love it anyhow, makes me cry.Frail and bedazzled- written for the monolith in 92-- we just never got around to investing the proper time into this lullabye we recorded this in about 1 hour, and i wished we has spent more time, but.. another message(*2) from the me vs. rock file. wrote these lyrics in the parking garage where i used to live/rehearse. it was very cold in there-but quiet. you could hear the squaking tires at night, sounded like ghosts or something, but i wrote this message from me to you. infinite lost at word sea. whir--another recorded in an hour type thingers that has been in the box. part of the glynis lineage lineage- sweeet and saddness ive wasted all my years. i must have written that line a zillion times, it jus just ended up here. sometimes when i listen to this i hear who we really are. frail and gentle- it is what is. rock powerx100.. note scary ending we would play that part for 15 minutes dum-de-dum-de dum. frail and bedazzled owes a great debt to the band skunK, with whom i ripped part of this song off. skunk was probably the greatest band that i ever knew/saw that is virtual: unknown-even less than the frogs. frogs. skunk. i miss skunk. blew away- blew away - written and produced by the man himself, welcome to james. quiet and cool and whispered. this is a beautiful song. the only song we have ever done that i was not 9did not stick my nose into) and i am glad i didn't. not to be confused with blue. and i love her....
pissant is one of the few things we have ever recorded live. done during the siamese dream sessions late at night and full of teenage pain. i made up all tese lyrics in 10 minutes got me a ray gun, got me an attitude, can;t help feeling somethings wrong with everone o everyone o you don't know what it's about don't care rawk. kerry and d"arcy tried to talk me into Putting this on hte album and i was tempted, but no i just couldn't see it in there amongst the tall trees. not as much shade or room for the little ones. plume-plume features the maestro phase, on loan from matt s. if you substract our two albums-there are 27 more songs, at least that have been released. there are another 15 to 20 to 30 hidden away but they aren't very good. i went back and listened to it all because i didn't want you to be bored, and i also decided to leave drown and glynis well enough alone. so there are 25 songs left to choose from cause well whatever but o the 25 out there were 3 more hidden away. 27-2=30 27-2+30-30+3=pXXXXs XXXXXXXXX oonteen in all (count 'em)? fourteen. at akL all kinda goes together in some sort of wayhello kitty kat-now this song was a toughy because i really had intended to put this on that album. but the ghosts of gish said no no no so i left it alone kinda because i really destroyed the mix. my most passive aggresive song. say hello before you say goodbye i should go before you make me cry she wants to bleed every drop inside of me but i aim to please the little girl inside of me too you know i hate say i always stay i don't want to be like the others please who"s sorry now if is how you how..............
love to love to love what you adore skgjgdfbdgkjdkjgblkbghphhnd dbkej;eb assemble a somehwat continious collection of this.
obscured is old because it was originally supposed to be on the lull e.p which was really supposed to be a single but they tricked me. written during gish recordings, we have finished it and let it sit for 2 years and then it came out as the b side of today i in the uk. the darkland.
so it was on all my friends taped and supposed to be on the next one but i swore i would never again re -record one of our own songs because it is lame to do so. 1991.what a year. such a pretty song, sunday in the park music chicagofest. blew away has kerry playing drums cause jimmy was on vacation. landslide is a stevie nicks song. i fell in love with this song and forced myself to learn it XXX because i'm very bad at figuring out songs by other people. o course i learned it totally the wrong way and after it was recorde recorded jimmy from the frogs showed me an easier way to play it. this song is very relevant to my life at this moment still, and that is why o loved to sing it. landslide-was recorded at the bbc, not my favourite place to record. favourite place to record. they are still in 1971 but ted the producer man was very nice. the recording is way to hissy and we're sorry but it is the fault of the bbc, whose financial raping of us to use this song and sandoz almost didn't make putting these songs out possible. but it is here,
starla-my friend aneta still says to me that this song should have been on siamese dream. but back again to that no record x2 rule. this was recorded at the same time a splume, and was also intended to be a demo, but we needed b-sides, for our prettyXXXXXXXXXXXX worthless i am one u.k. single (the dark continent) so in a way plume and starla were they're own single if that make makes any sense at all. recorded over time, or recorded at two different sessions, one for vocals and solos and one for drums, erc,.another song with lyrics written at the last second. i wrote the middle part on the back of an eXXX envelope--serve yourself no one else can do for you like you an do one el else fails like me but in my eyes i i burn alive no more words just you and i high in the sky--some of my favourite lyrics. better that i did not care solo played at 7am. listen for the police car going bye. blue is the only gish outtake represented here. from the lull single! viva lull
and remastered by our man howie for yer listnin' pleasure. yet another sad and happy song from the o'corrigan file. i thought about using an acoustic version of this song for this album, but it seemed silly to have a different version of an unknown song. maybe someday . on tour forever, blue i lay with you this velvet morning sa stat stay with me for a while a million yeses and no's strewn across 6 long years. but all it adds up to something even if you are not quite sure of what that is. a girl named Sandoz-from our XX slightly infamous john Peel session. we of course showed up expecting to meet john peel, but it's not like that at all. we were 2 hours late due to technicak misunderstanding-- but we e
we were treated so poorly bX thi by this idiot who used to be the drummer from mott the supple that it is probably *l on our all time worst experiences list. this was originally recorded by the animals roughly around the time that jimy hendrix went to england to become... well you catch my drift. vented thru many years o out and out riffdom, this still sounds powerful to my jaded years, i mean we meant it back then,, but that was long agoe.
but that was long a go-go, so now listen hear, i want to be so oh so clear si so we only ended up recording 3 songs that day (siva and smiley too) because it was so uptight, but i'm glad we did tolerate that XXXXXXXX mott the nipple that day even though i don't think we would now.
i met this girl in dallas when we were on tour with the chili peppa's and that was where i got the idea for the name for the song because when she said her name i thought wow, what a XXX great title for a song. 2.25 years late later i run into this same girl at a party and i say did you hear that song we recorded using youur name, starla? and she said, no my name is darla but heXy starla, darla whatever it doesn't matter, so there you go. never trust a girl who ends up with, well i can't say. i am very proud of all these songs songs because they have persevered time and space and albums and most o all subjective opinion. yours truly included. La dolly vita -so old yet it is kinda timeless in a strange way. i think it is because it has a dignity all it's own. we also tried to re-record this for gish, but my heart was not in it. so many mistakes but the raygun is always on i catch my assumptipn. mary's always on the shoulder and the devil has his pitchwork on that backside o yours. la dolly vita, true as blue shy sky, cool as ice cream
the b-side o our second single recorded with butch vig. we recorded this and tristessa on the same day somewhere in the past and it was also the first day XXXXXXX we met butch v. still one o my favourite hidden songs, this brings b back many memories. sorry, a tad too personal. be careful what you say but be really careful what you don't say. spaced-is kinda hard to explain so i won't, but i you listen real close you can hear the 7 secrets of the 7 veils of apollo. part of the siamese desbris collection. thanks for being anf thanks for listening and thanks for getting angry and happy and sad all at the same time. life is everything and nothing at all at onece-if i may filanthripize--1/2 and we hope we mean those things to you. till next sign
billy c.
somebody X comes up to you in a bar and asks them if you are who they think you are, and then you say if you know then i am if you don't then i'm not.special thanks to everyone for their continued support

subtract, multiply. a message from above and below. my moleasskiss to your precious lips. don't think. just be my sweet sweet. two albums and some 27 other songs later-b-sides-complyiations, covers, soundtracks-this here is an assemblage of , well stuff. songs never meant to come out, some written with such high hopes.....
all special to the heart. from sub-plop to wergen, here 'tis.sadness and happiness.soothe-recorded in me bedroom at my old apartement. you can hear the 7am buses slithering by. i used to go to sleep to the flanging car noises. the hiss that we had missed. i really only wanted this to be for me. but my friend said "i don't think you can improve on that. so i left it be. plume- a groover from the iha file- assembled i - in same said bedroom and recorded only a couple of days later at kerry's studio. another demo thing that turned ugly and mean and got released. we didn't have any bass so we "borrowed" eric from deep blue dream's--he never knew and were sorry we didn't tell you eric but it sounds good. i know i wrote some of the lyrics waiting for my dad to pick me up from the aeroport. my boredom has outshined the sun. sometimes you don't spend as much time on the lyrics-ansX and sometimes they're better-more how you REALLY feel. soothe- a song for my babies. children of the earth and such. i wanted to put this on siamese dream but i x wimped out. shoulda coulda kinda didn't but i love it anyhow, makes me cry.Frail and bedazzled- written for the monolith in 92-- we just never got around to investing the proper time into this lullabye we recorded this in about 1 hour, and i wished we has spent more time, but.. another message(*2) from the me vs. rock file. wrote these lyrics in the parking garage where i used to live/rehearse. it was very cold in there-but quiet. you could hear the squaking tires at night, sounded like ghosts or something, but i wrote this message from me to you. infinite lost at word sea. whir--another recorded in an hour type thingers that has been in the box. part of the glynis lineage lineage- sweeet and saddness ive wasted all my years. i must have written that line a zillion times, it jus just ended up here. sometimes when i listen to this i hear who we really are. frail and gentle- it is what is. rock powerx100.. note scary ending we would play that part for 15 minutes dum-de-dum-de dum. frail and bedazzled owes a great debt to the band skunK, with whom i ripped part of this song off. skunk was probably the greatest band that i ever knew/saw that is virtual: unknown-even less than the frogs. frogs. skunk. i miss skunk. blew away- blew away - written and produced by the man himself, welcome to james. quiet and cool and whispered. this is a beautiful song. the only song we have ever done that i was not 9did not stick my nose into) and i am glad i didn't. not to be confused with blue. and i love her....
pissant is one of the few things we have ever recorded live. done during the siamese dream sessions late at night and full of teenage pain. i made up all tese lyrics in 10 minutes got me a ray gun, got me an attitude, can;t help feeling somethings wrong with everone o everyone o you don't know what it's about don't care rawk. kerry and d"arcy tried to talk me into Putting this on hte album and i was tempted, but no i just couldn't see it in there amongst the tall trees. not as much shade or room for the little ones. plume-plume features the maestro phase, on loan from matt s. if you substract our two albums-there are 27 more songs, at least that have been released. there are another 15 to 20 to 30 hidden away but they aren't very good. i went back and listened to it all because i didn't want you to be bored, and i also decided to leave drown and glynis well enough alone. so there are 25 songs left to choose from cause well whatever but o the 25 out there were 3 more hidden away. 27-2=30 27-2+30-30+3=pXXXXs XXXXXXXXX oonteen in all (count 'em)? fourteen. at akL all kinda goes together in some sort of wayhello kitty kat-now this song was a toughy because i really had intended to put this on that album. but the ghosts of gish said no no no so i left it alone kinda because i really destroyed the mix. my most passive aggresive song. say hello before you say goodbye i should go before you make me cry she wants to bleed every drop inside of me but i aim to please the little girl inside of me too you know i hate say i always stay i don't want to be like the others please who"s sorry now if is how you how..............
love to love to love what you adore skgjgdfbdgkjdkjgblkbghphhnd dbkej;eb assemble a somehwat continious collection of this.
obscured is old because it was originally supposed to be on the lull e.p which was really supposed to be a single but they tricked me. written during gish recordings, we have finished it and let it sit for 2 years and then it came out as the b side of today i in the uk. the darkland.
so it was on all my friends taped and supposed to be on the next one but i swore i would never again re -record one of our own songs because it is lame to do so. 1991.what a year. such a pretty song, sunday in the park music chicagofest. blew away has kerry playing drums cause jimmy was on vacation. landslide is a stevie nicks song. i fell in love with this song and forced myself to learn it XXX because i'm very bad at figuring out songs by other people. o course i learned it totally the wrong way and after it was recorde recorded jimmy from the frogs showed me an easier way to play it. this song is very relevant to my life at this moment still, and that is why o loved to sing it. landslide-was recorded at the bbc, not my favourite place to record. favourite place to record. they are still in 1971 but ted the producer man was very nice. the recording is way to hissy and we're sorry but it is the fault of the bbc, whose financial raping of us to use this song and sandoz almost didn't make putting these songs out possible. but it is here,
starla-my friend aneta still says to me that this song should have been on siamese dream. but back again to that no record x2 rule. this was recorded at the same time a splume, and was also intended to be a demo, but we needed b-sides, for our prettyXXXXXXXXXXXX worthless i am one u.k. single (the dark continent) so in a way plume and starla were they're own single if that make makes any sense at all. recorded over time, or recorded at two different sessions, one for vocals and solos and one for drums, erc,.another song with lyrics written at the last second. i wrote the middle part on the back of an eXXX envelope--serve yourself no one else can do for you like you an do one el else fails like me but in my eyes i i burn alive no more words just you and i high in the sky--some of my favourite lyrics. better that i did not care solo played at 7am. listen for the police car going bye. blue is the only gish outtake represented here. from the lull single! viva lull
and remastered by our man howie for yer listnin' pleasure. yet another sad and happy song from the o'corrigan file. i thought about using an acoustic version of this song for this album, but it seemed silly to have a different version of an unknown song. maybe someday . on tour forever, blue i lay with you this velvet morning sa stat stay with me for a while a million yeses and no's strewn across 6 long years. but all it adds up to something even if you are not quite sure of what that is. a girl named Sandoz-from our XX slightly infamous john Peel session. we of course showed up expecting to meet john peel, but it's not like that at all. we were 2 hours late due to technicak misunderstanding-- but we e
we were treated so poorly bX thi by this idiot who used to be the drummer from mott the supple that it is probably *l on our all time worst experiences list. this was originally recorded by the animals roughly around the time that jimy hendrix went to england to become... well you catch my drift. vented thru many years o out and out riffdom, this still sounds powerful to my jaded years, i mean we meant it back then,, but that was long agoe.
but that was long a go-go, so now listen hear, i want to be so oh so clear si so we only ended up recording 3 songs that day (siva and smiley too) because it was so uptight, but i'm glad we did tolerate that XXXXXXXX mott the nipple that day even though i don't think we would now.
i met this girl in dallas when we were on tour with the chili peppa's and that was where i got the idea for the name for the song because when she said her name i thought wow, what a XXX great title for a song. 2.25 years late later i run into this same girl at a party and i say did you hear that song we recorded using youur name, starla? and she said, no my name is darla but heXy starla, darla whatever it doesn't matter, so there you go. never trust a girl who ends up with, well i can't say. i am very proud of all these songs songs because they have persevered time and space and albums and most o all subjective opinion. yours truly included. La dolly vita -so old yet it is kinda timeless in a strange way. i think it is because it has a dignity all it's own. we also tried to re-record this for gish, but my heart was not in it. so many mistakes but the raygun is always on i catch my assumptipn. mary's always on the shoulder and the devil has his pitchwork on that backside o yours. la dolly vita, true as blue shy sky, cool as ice cream
the b-side o our second single recorded with butch vig. we recorded this and tristessa on the same day somewhere in the past and it was also the first day XXXXXXX we met butch v. still one o my favourite hidden songs, this brings b back many memories. sorry, a tad too personal. be careful what you say but be really careful what you don't say. spaced-is kinda hard to explain so i won't, but i you listen real close you can hear the 7 secrets of the 7 veils of apollo. part of the siamese desbris collection. thanks for being anf thanks for listening and thanks for getting angry and happy and sad all at the same time. life is everything and nothing at all at onece-if i may filanthripize--1/2 and we hope we mean those things to you. till next sign
billy c.
somebody X comes up to you in a bar and asks them if you are who they think you are, and then you say if you know then i am if you don't then i'm not.special thanks to everyone for their continued support
and a fuck to those who will never understand
love, peace, empathy, desire, mischief, and gladness

subtract, multiply. a message from above and below. my moleasskiss to your precious lips. don't think. just be my sweet sweet. two albums and some 27 other songs later-b-sides-complyiations, covers, soundtracks-this here is an assemblage of , well stuff. songs never meant to come out, some written with such high hopes.....
all special to the heart. from sub-plop to wergen, here 'tis.sadness and happiness.soothe-recorded in me bedroom at my old apartement. you can hear the 7am buses slithering by. i used to go to sleep to the flanging car noises. the hiss that we had missed. i really only wanted this to be for me. but my friend said "i don't think you can improve on that. so i left it be. plume- a groover from the iha file- assembled i - in same said bedroom and recorded only a couple of days later at kerry's studio. another demo thing that turned ugly and mean and got released. we didn't have any bass so we "borrowed" eric from deep blue dream's--he never knew and were sorry we didn't tell you eric but it sounds good. i know i wrote some of the lyrics waiting for my dad to pick me up from the aeroport. my boredom has outshined the sun. sometimes you don't spend as much time on the lyrics-ansX and sometimes they're better-more how you REALLY feel. soothe- a song for my babies. children of the earth and such. i wanted to put this on siamese dream but i x wimped out. shoulda coulda kinda didn't but i love it anyhow, makes me cry.Frail and bedazzled- written for the monolith in 92-- we just never got around to investing the proper time into this lullabye we recorded this in about 1 hour, and i wished we has spent more time, but.. another message(*2) from the me vs. rock file. wrote these lyrics in the parking garage where i used to live/rehearse. it was very cold in there-but quiet. you could hear the squaking tires at night, sounded like ghosts or something, but i wrote this message from me to you. infinite lost at word sea. whir--another recorded in an hour type thingers that has been in the box. part of the glynis lineage lineage- sweeet and saddness ive wasted all my years. i must have written that line a zillion times, it jus just ended up here. sometimes when i listen to this i hear who we really are. frail and gentle- it is what is. rock powerx100.. note scary ending we would play that part for 15 minutes dum-de-dum-de dum. frail and bedazzled owes a great debt to the band skunK, with whom i ripped part of this song off. skunk was probably the greatest band that i ever knew/saw that is virtual: unknown-even less than the frogs. frogs. skunk. i miss skunk. blew away- blew away - written and produced by the man himself, welcome to james. quiet and cool and whispered. this is a beautiful song. the only song we have ever done that i was not 9did not stick my nose into) and i am glad i didn't. not to be confused with blue. and i love her....
pissant is one of the few things we have ever recorded live. done during the siamese dream sessions late at night and full of teenage pain. i made up all tese lyrics in 10 minutes got me a ray gun, got me an attitude, can;t help feeling somethings wrong with everone o everyone o you don't know what it's about don't care rawk. kerry and d"arcy tried to talk me into Putting this on hte album and i was tempted, but no i just couldn't see it in there amongst the tall trees. not as much shade or room for the little ones. plume-plume features the maestro phase, on loan from matt s. if you substract our two albums-there are 27 more songs, at least that have been released. there are another 15 to 20 to 30 hidden away but they aren't very good. i went back and listened to it all because i didn't want you to be bored, and i also decided to leave drown and glynis well enough alone. so there are 25 songs left to choose from cause well whatever but o the 25 out there were 3 more hidden away. 27-2=30 27-2+30-30+3=pXXXXs XXXXXXXXX oonteen in all (count 'em)? fourteen. at akL all kinda goes together in some sort of wayhello kitty kat-now this song was a toughy because i really had intended to put this on that album. but the ghosts of gish said no no no so i left it alone kinda because i really destroyed the mix. my most passive aggresive song. say hello before you say goodbye i should go before you make me cry she wants to bleed every drop inside of me but i aim to please the little girl inside of me too you know i hate say i always stay i don't want to be like the others please who"s sorry now if is how you how..............
love to love to love what you adore skgjgdfbdgkjdkjgblkbghphhnd dbkej;eb assemble a somehwat continious collection of this.
obscured is old because it was originally supposed to be on the lull e.p which was really supposed to be a single but they tricked me. written during gish recordings, we have finished it and let it sit for 2 years and then it came out as the b side of today i in the uk. the darkland.
so it was on all my friends taped and supposed to be on the next one but i swore i would never again re -record one of our own songs because it is lame to do so. 1991.what a year. such a pretty song, sunday in the park music chicagofest. blew away has kerry playing drums cause jimmy was on vacation. landslide is a stevie nicks song. i fell in love with this song and forced myself to learn it XXX because i'm very bad at figuring out songs by other people. o course i learned it totally the wrong way and after it was recorde recorded jimmy from the frogs showed me an easier way to play it. this song is very relevant to my life at this moment still, and that is why o loved to sing it. landslide-was recorded at the bbc, not my favourite place to record. favourite place to record. they are still in 1971 but ted the producer man was very nice. the recording is way to hissy and we're sorry but it is the fault of the bbc, whose financial raping of us to use this song and sandoz almost didn't make putting these songs out possible. but it is here,
starla-my friend aneta still says to me that this song should have been on siamese dream. but back again to that no record x2 rule. this was recorded at the same time a splume, and was also intended to be a demo, but we needed b-sides, for our prettyXXXXXXXXXXXX worthless i am one u.k. single (the dark continent) so in a way plume and starla were they're own single if that make makes any sense at all. recorded over time, or recorded at two different sessions, one for vocals and solos and one for drums, erc,.another song with lyrics written at the last second. i wrote the middle part on the back of an eXXX envelope--serve yourself no one else can do for you like you an do one el else fails like me but in my eyes i i burn alive no more words just you and i high in the sky--some of my favourite lyrics. better that i did not care solo played at 7am. listen for the police car going bye. blue is the only gish outtake represented here. from the lull single! viva lull
and remastered by our man howie for yer listnin' pleasure. yet another sad and happy song from the o'corrigan file. i thought about using an acoustic version of this song for this album, but it seemed silly to have a different version of an unknown song. maybe someday . on tour forever, blue i lay with you this velvet morning sa stat stay with me for a while a million yeses and no's strewn across 6 long years. but all it adds up to something even if you are not quite sure of what that is. a girl named Sandoz-from our XX slightly infamous john Peel session. we of course showed up expecting to meet john peel, but it's not like that at all. we were 2 hours late due to technicak misunderstanding-- but we e
we were treated so poorly bX thi by this idiot who used to be the drummer from mott the supple that it is probably *l on our all time worst experiences list. this was originally recorded by the animals roughly around the time that jimy hendrix went to england to become... well you catch my drift. vented thru many years o out and out riffdom, this still sounds powerful to my jaded years, i mean we meant it back then,, but that was long agoe.
but that was long a go-go, so now listen hear, i want to be so oh so clear si so we only ended up recording 3 songs that day (siva and smiley too) because it was so uptight, but i'm glad we did tolerate that XXXXXXXX mott the nipple that day even though i don't think we would now.
i met this girl in dallas when we were on tour with the chili peppa's and that was where i got the idea for the name for the song because when she said her name i thought wow, what a XXX great title for a song. 2.25 years late later i run into this same girl at a party and i say did you hear that song we recorded using youur name, starla? and she said, no my name is darla but heXy starla, darla whatever it doesn't matter, so there you go. never trust a girl who ends up with, well i can't say. i am very proud of all these songs songs because they have persevered time and space and albums and most o all subjective opinion. yours truly included. La dolly vita -so old yet it is kinda timeless in a strange way. i think it is because it has a dignity all it's own. we also tried to re-record this for gish, but my heart was not in it. so many mistakes but the raygun is always on i catch my assumptipn. mary's always on the shoulder and the devil has his pitchwork on that backside o yours. la dolly vita, true as blue shy sky, cool as ice cream
the b-side o our second single recorded with butch vig. we recorded this and tristessa on the same day somewhere in the past and it was also the first day XXXXXXX we met butch v. still one o my favourite hidden songs, this brings b back many memories. sorry, a tad too personal. be careful what you say but be really careful what you don't say. spaced-is kinda hard to explain so i won't, but i you listen real close you can hear the 7 secrets of the 7 veils of apollo. part of the siamese desbris collection. thanks for being anf thanks for listening and thanks for getting angry and happy and sad all at the same time. life is everything and nothing at all at onece-if i may filanthripize--1/2 and we hope we mean those things to you. till next sign

pissant is one of the few things we have ever recorded live. done during the siamese dream sessions late at night and full of teenage pain. i made up all tese lyrics in 10 minutes got me a ray gun, got me an attitude, can;t help feeling somethings wrong with everone o everyone o you don't know what it's about don't care rawk. kerry and d"arcy tried to talk me into Putting this on hte album and i was tempted, but no i just couldn't see it in there amongst the tall trees. not as much shade or room for the little ones. plume-plume features the maestro phase, on loan from matt s. if you substract our two albums-there are 27 more songs, at least that have been released. there are another 15 to 20 to 30 hidden away but they aren't very good. i went back and listened to it all because i didn't want you to be bored, and i also decided to leave drown and glynis well enough alone. so there are 25 songs left to choose from cause well whatever but o the 25 out there were 3 more hidden away. 27-2=30 27-2+30-30+3=pXXXXs XXXXXXXXX oonteen in all (count 'em)? fourteen. at akL all kinda goes together in some sort of wayhello kitty kat-now this song was a toughy because i really had intended to put this on that album. but the ghosts of gish said no no no so i left it alone kinda because i really destroyed the mix. my most passive aggresive song. say hello before you say goodbye i should go before you make me cry she wants to bleed every drop inside of me but i aim to please the little girl inside of me too you know i hate say i always stay i don't want to be like the others please who"s sorry now if is how you how..............
love to love to love what you adore skgjgdfbdgkjdkjgblkbghphhnd dbkej;eb assemble a somehwat continious collection of this.
obscured is old because it was originally supposed to be on the lull e.p which was really supposed to be a single but they tricked me. written during gish recordings, we have finished it and let it sit for 2 years and then it came out as the b side of today i in the uk. the darkland.
so it was on all my friends taped and supposed to be on the next one but i swore i would never again re -record one of our own songs because it is lame to do so. 1991.what a year. such a pretty song, sunday in the park music chicagofest. blew away has kerry playing drums cause jimmy was on vacation. landslide is a stevie nicks song. i fell in love with this song and forced myself to learn it XXX because i'm very bad at figuring out songs by other people. o course i learned it totally the wrong way and after it was recorde recorded jimmy from the frogs showed me an easier way to play it. this song is very relevant to my life at this moment still, and that is why o loved to sing it. landslide-was recorded at the bbc, not my favourite place to record. favourite place to record. they are still in 1971 but ted the producer man was very nice. the recording is way to hissy and we're sorry but it is the fault of the bbc, whose financial raping of us to use this song and sandoz almost didn't make putting these songs out possible. but it is here,
starla-my friend aneta still says to me that this song should have been on siamese dream. but back again to that no record x2 rule. this was recorded at the same time a splume, and was also intended to be a demo, but we needed b-sides, for our prettyXXXXXXXXXXXX worthless i am one u.k. single (the dark continent) so in a way plume and starla were they're own single if that make makes any sense at all. recorded over time, or recorded at two different sessions, one for vocals and solos and one for drums, erc,.another song with lyrics written at the last second. i wrote the middle part on the back of an eXXX envelope--serve yourself no one else can do for you like you an do one el else fails like me but in my eyes i i burn alive no more words just you and i high in the sky--some of my favourite lyrics. better that i did not care solo played at 7am. listen for the police car going bye. blue is the only gish outtake represented here. from the lull single! viva lull
and remastered by our man howie for yer listnin' pleasure. yet another sad and happy song from the o'corrigan file. i thought about using an acoustic version of this song for this album, but it seemed silly to have a different version of an unknown song. maybe someday . on tour forever, blue i lay with you this velvet morning sa stat stay with me for a while a million yeses and no's strewn across 6 long years. but all it adds up to something even if you are not quite sure of what that is. a girl named Sandoz-from our XX slightly infamous john Peel session. we of course showed up expecting to meet john peel, but it's not like that at all. we were 2 hours late due to technicak misunderstanding-- but we e
we were treated so poorly bX thi by this idiot who used to be the drummer from mott the supple that it is probably *l on our all time worst experiences list. this was originally recorded by the animals roughly around the time that jimy hendrix went to england to become... well you catch my drift. vented thru many years o out and out riffdom, this still sounds powerful to my jaded years, i mean we meant it back then,, but that was long agoe.
but that was long a go-go, so now listen hear, i want to be so oh so clear si so we only ended up recording 3 songs that day (siva and smiley too) because it was so uptight, but i'm glad we did tolerate that XXXXXXXX mott the nipple that day even though i don't think we would now.
i met this girl in dallas when we were on tour with the chili peppa's and that was where i got the idea for the name for the song because when she said her name i thought wow, what a XXX great title for a song. 2.25 years late later i run into this same girl at a party and i say did you hear that song we recorded using youur name, starla? and she said, no my name is darla but heXy starla, darla whatever it doesn't matter, so there you go. never trust a girl who ends up with, well i can't say. i am very proud of all these songs songs because they have persevered time and space and albums and most o all subjective opinion. yours truly included. La dolly vita -so old yet it is kinda timeless in a strange way. i think it is because it has a dignity all it's own. we also tried to re-record this for gish, but my heart was not in it. so many mistakes but the raygun is always on i catch my assumptipn. mary's always on the shoulder and the devil has his pitchwork on that backside o yours. la dolly vita, true as blue shy sky, cool as ice cream
the b-side o our second single recorded with butch vig. we recorded this and tristessa on the same day somewhere in the past and it was also the first day XXXXXXX we met butch v. still one o my favourite hidden songs, this brings b back many memories. sorry, a tad too personal. be careful what you say but be really careful what you don't say. spaced-is kinda hard to explain so i won't, but i you listen real close you can hear the 7 secrets of the 7 veils of apollo. part of the siamese desbris collection. thanks for being anf thanks for listening and thanks for getting angry and happy and sad all at the same time. life is everything and nothing at all at onece-if i may filanthripize--1/2 and we hope we mean those things to you. till next sign
