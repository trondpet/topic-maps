Various topic maps that I created/generated from various sources in my past life.

* bccom.ltm: contains info on "original" Smashing Pumpkins lyrics, discography, etc. Used to power billy-corgan.com between 2009-2012. Contents from old MySQL database of mine that used to power billy-corgan.com way back when...

* shaketm.ltm: Shakespeare's plays in LTM format. Generated from the source over at http://www.cafeconleche.org/examples/shakespeare/.

Use e.g. [Ontopia Omnigator](http://www.ontopia.net/) to explore these topic maps - I prob. won't put together a web app for exploration in the near foreseeable future.
